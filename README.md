# Investigating Buying Patterns
 
<b>Objective:</b> Explore customer transaction data, from recent online and in-store sales, and see if you can infer any insights about customer purchasing behavior.<br><br>
The following questions should be addressed: <br>
<ul>
	<li>Do customers in different regions spend more on purchases?</li>
 	<li>Are in-store customers older than online customers?</li>
	<li>What age spends the most money on purchases?</li>
  <li>Which customers are more likely to purchase online?</li>
</ul>

<b>Data Composition:</b> Dataset was comprised of $66M worth (or 80,000 rows) of transactional data containing the following 5 attributes. 
<ul>
	<li>Type of Purchase (Online or In-Store)</li>
 	<li>Amount of Purchase ($5 - $3000)</li>
	<li>Number of Items Purchased (1 - 8 items)</li>
  <li>Customer Age (18 - 85 years old)</li>
 	<li>Region of Purchase (North, South, East, West)</li>
</ul>

## <b>Conclusion:</b> <em><b> (comprehensive conclusion attached in github)</em></b>
<ul>
	<li>Customers in the Western Region spend the most per purchase and account for $33M (or 50%) of total sales.</li>
	<li>The Southern Region had nearly 20,000 transactions under $500 and only 34 transactions over $500.</li>
	<li>Regardless of the number of items purchased, the average cost per transaction didnâ€™t waver.</li>
  <li>Customers under 62 years old account for 93% of total sales.</li>
  <li>Customers under 40 years old spend the most per purchase.</li>
</ul>
<b>Northern Region:</b><ul>
	<li>Average age is 43.</li>
	<li>Shops 100% in-store.</li>
	<li>Spends $745 on average per transaction.</li>
</ul>
<b>Southern Region:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Oldest region - average age is 56.</li>
	<li>Shops 100% online</li>
	<li>Spends less than other regions with $252 average per transaction. </li>
</ul>
<b>Eastern Region:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Average age is 45.</li>
	<li>Shops 61% online & 39% in-store.</li>
	<li>Spends $918 on average per transaction.</li>
</ul>
<b>Western Region:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Youngest region - average age is 38.</li>
	<li>Shops 50% online & 50% in store.</li>
	<li>Spends most than other region with $1,284 average per transaction.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Business Recommendations:</b><br> <br>
<ul>
  <li>Focus marketing efforts in Northern & Southern region to increase sales. </li>
  <li>Run promotional sales for higher-priced products in the South Region.</li>
  <li>The Southern Region shops 100% online, spends the least and is the oldest. If there is a brick & mortar store in this region, the recommendation would be to close the store to reduce expenses. Alternatively, opening a brick & mortar store, if there is not one, could bring in more profits.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br><br>

<b>Future Data Mining Considerations:</b><br>

<ul>
  <li>Researching the Southern Region to understand local consumer base and existing business assets to determine if future assets should be established or not.</li>
  <li>Capture the date of the transaction to determine seasonality/predictability of purchases.</li>
  <li>Capture transaction time to determine optimal hours of operation for a store and aid with proper staffing of the store.</li>
  <li>Gather additional customer data to track customer retention.</li>
  <li>With customer retention data, better project and obtain sales goals.</li> 
  <li>Collect product information to understand what items are being purchased in-store vs. online.</li>
  <li>Collect gender information to better understand customer demographics.</li>
 </ul>

## Lessons Learned:

<b>Data Science process -</b>
<ol>
  <li>Frame the business problem.</li> 
  <li>Collect raw data.</li>
  <li>Process the data.</li>
  <li>Explore the data.</li>
  <li>Perform in-depth analysis</li>
  <li>Communicate results</li>
 </ol> 
<br> 
<b>Pre-processing Data - </b> After understanding the business goal and collect the data you will need to perform pre-processing. Pre-processing data includes (but is not limited to) manage duplicates, handle incomplete responses, integrate datasets, convert data types, translate data where necessary, rename attributes, format order of attributes, identify outliers, and perform fundamental statistical analysis (i.e. count, min, mean, max, std, etc.).
<br><br>
<b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - </b> EDA is used to summarize the content of the dataset by visualizing patterns to conclude.
